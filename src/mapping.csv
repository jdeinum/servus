# ROW-ORIENTED, LAST-CRAWL-DATE, CRAWL-FREQUENCY, UPDATE-TYPE, KEYWORDS, SHEET_NUMBER, TITLE, DESCRIPTION, LABELS, CONTENT, URL, [RELATIVE], [FILE-TYPE], [CUT]
#
# 1: ROW-ORIENTED
# Should be "R" if the data is row oriented. "C" if the data is column oriented
#
# Typically if the labels are arranged in a row, then it is row oriented
#
# 2: LAST_CRAWL_DATE
# Specifies the last date a webpage was crawled
#
# Each time the program is run, it will update this field to the current date
#
#
# 3: CRAWL-FREQUENCY
# Specify how often you want the data to be crawled
#   "daily"
#   "weekly"
#   "monthly"
#   "quarterly"
#   "yearly"
#
# 4: UPDATE-TYPE
# Specify the type of update machanism the table uses
#
# If rows are added to existing data, then update type is 'REPLACE' , if
# the old data is removed and new data is added, then update is 'ADD'
#
#
# 5: KEYWORDS
# Have some keywords assoicated with the data
# This only has implactions for queries and can be left blank if desired
#
# Seperate keywords with a colon ( : ), i.e oil:energy:gas
#
# 6: SHEET-NUMBER:
# Only appplicable for xlsx files, leave blank for csv
#
# Specify the sheet number where the data is found
# 
#
# 7/8/9/10: DATA
# Provide either a string, or a method to find the location of each column 
# within the file. 
#
# Currently there are 3 ways of specifying a location in a file:
#   a) Row number
#   b) Tag + Offset
#   c) END
#
#
# In some cases, it may be desirable to specify a range of rows. To do so, 
# just specify two locations (using either (a) or (b) and seperate them with
# a colon. i.e "OBSERVATIONS"+1:END in the CONTENT field tells the program
# that the start of the content is one rows below the "OBSERVATIONS", and 
# goes to the end of the file
#
# One important thing to note is that if you use a row number to mark the end
# of the data, when new rows are added, they will not be updated, since they
# have a bigger row number, use END whenever you can
#
# 11: URL
# Specify the URL of the table / site to be scraped.
#
# The URL can contain a wildcard * to specify that you would like to scrape all
# of the tables on a particular website.
#
#
# 12: RELATIVE
#
# Only required if the URL uses a wildcard
#
# Specify if the website uses relative addressing or absolute
# addressing. This can be found by going to the site, right clicking on a link
# and clicking inspect. In the highlighted section at the bottom, there should
# be some text of the form: href='SOMETHING'. If the something starts with a "/"
# then relative should be 'R' , otherwise it should be 'A'. This option is only
# important if you are using wildcard expansion.
#
# 13: FILE-TYPE
# Only required if the URL contains a wildcard
#
# Specify what kind of files you want to extract. Currently the
# only 2 supported options are 'csv' and 'xlsx'.
#
# 14: CUT
# Only required if the URL contains a wildcard
#
# Some websites use relative addressing but not to your base address. 
# Consider the following example: The base URL of the site you want to scrape 
# is www.abcd.com/e     The website uses relative addressing, however it is
# relative to www.abcd.com    , then the CUT would be /e , since we cut out
# this component of the base url before scraping.
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
# HOW DATA IS UPDATED:
# Once the data is within the database, the program (if run once a day at midnight) 
# will ensure that new and/or modified rows will be present in the database. The 
# entry in the mapping file can be removed if desired, or altered to make some changes
# to your table.
#
#
#
# HOW DATA IS DELETED:
# To delete an entry, enter a line of the following format in your mapping file:
# D@URL_TO_BE_DELETED
#
# Wildcards work the same way for deleing as they do for scraping.
# 
# example:
# D@https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/*
# 
# The entry above will delete all data associated with that url from our
# database
